name: Create a deployment status
description: |
  Users with `push` access can create deployment statuses for a given deployment.  GitHub Apps require `read & write` access to "Deployments" and `read-only` access to "Repo contents" (for private repos). OAuth Apps require the `repo_deployment` scope.

  state:
    description: |
      The state of the status. Can be one of `error`, `failure`, `inactive`, `in_progress`, `queued` `pending`, or `success`. **Note:** To use the `inactive` state, you must provide the [`application/vnd.github.ant-man-preview+json`](https://developer.github.com/v3/previews/#enhanced-deployments) custom media type. To use the `in_progress` and `queued` states, you must provide the [`application/vnd.github.flash-preview+json`](https://developer.github.com/v3/previews/#deployment-statuses) custom media type.

  target_url:
    description: |
      The target URL to associate with this status. This URL should contain output to keep the user updated while the task is running or serve as historical information for what happened in the deployment. **Note:** It's recommended to use the `log_url` parameter, which replaces `target_url`.

      The full URL of the deployment's output. This parameter replaces `target_url`. We will continue to accept `target_url` to support legacy uses, but we recommend replacing `target_url` with `log_url`. Setting `log_url` will automatically set `target_url` to the same value.
